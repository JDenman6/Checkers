# Checkers
AppAcademy W2D4 checkers assignment

Phase I and Phase II are complete. The pieces and the board are ready. 
Phase III will be to create a game class that will act as a user interface. 
I would like to add
 - checkerboard colorization to rendering
 - turn handling for human players
 - turn handling for computer players
 - simple computer AI
 - and more

These additions will have to wait for now. I'm switching over to assessment prep for tonight.
