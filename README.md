# Checkers
AppAcademy W2D4 checkers assignment

Phase I and Phase II are complete. The pieces and the board are ready. 
Phase III will be to create a game class that will act as a user interface. 

I must add
 - a board setup method
 - turn handling for human players
 - turn handling or computer players (random valid move)

I would like to add
 - checkerboard colorization to rendering
 - simple computer AI (add some strategy)
 - and more

These additions will have to wait for now. I'm switching over to assessment prep for tonight.
